The Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, provides important ecological and economical services, making it the target of restoration projects and supporting a significant fishery/aquaculture industry with landings valued at more than $100 million in 2012. While traditional breeding practices have achieved production of oyster lines with fast growth and improved disease resistance, little is known about the genetic basis of traits of commercial, biological, and ecological importance. Advanced molecular breeding techniques necessitate information regarding markers and genes associated with these traits. The goal of this research is to develop tools and resources to assist in the elucidation of the genomic basis of traits of commercial, biological, evolutionary, and ecological interest in the Eastern oyster. We propose to develop these key resources and tools by performing the sequencing, assembly, and annotation of a reference genome and transcriptome for the Eastern oyster C. virginica. Genome researchers and bioinformatics experts, in collaboration with the Eastern Oyster Genome Consortium, will use state-of-the-art sequencing and assembly strategies to achieve these aims. These reference genome and transcriptomes for the Eastern oysters will aid the research community in the discovery of candidate genes and markers associated with traits of commercial, biological, and ecological importance in oysters.","organism":{"organism_name":"Crassostrea virginica","tax_id":6565},"title":"Invertebrate sample from Crassostrea virginica"},"last_updated":"2017-08-28T22:08:17.183","models":["Invertebrate"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"McDonnell Genome Institute - Washington University School of Medicine"},"package":"Invertebrate.1.0","publication_date":"2017-02-20T00:00:00.000","sample_ids":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"RU13XGHG1 #28"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS2474868"}],"status":{"status":"live","when":"2017-02-20T12:14:03.946"},"submission_date":"2017-02-20T12:14:03.943"},"blast_url":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch\u0026PROG_DEF=blastn\u0026BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCF_002022765.2","comments":"Crassostrea virginica sequence assembly C_virginica-3.0 release notes:\nWe have sequenced the genome of the Eastern oyster using DNA from a gynogenetic oyster of an inbred line produced at the Haskin Shellfish Research Laboratory, Rutgers University, known as sample RU13XGHG1-28 from either a single tissue or pooled extracts from two tissues (mantle, adductor muscle). Sequences were generated on the Pacific Biosciences RSII instrument (P6/C4 chemistry) to approx. 74x genome coverage based on a genome size estimate of 675 Mb. All reads were assembled with the FALCON algorithm then error corrected using the Quiver and Pilon algorithms. Scaffolds were generated with the SSPACE-LongRead software. We determined the initial draft assembly contained a high number of single copy gene counts suggesting assembly of heterozygous loci. To ensure proper gene annotation we attempted to generate a mostly haploid representation of the draft assembly using transcript mapping to the draft assembly. All contigs were retained in the C_virginica-3.0 assembly that had single best hits to transcripts.\nOf the 685 Mb genome (C_virginica-3.0), the total assembly N50 contig and scaffold lengths are 1.97Mb (n=668) and 75.94Mb (n=10), respectively.\nFor questions regarding this C_virginica-3.0 assembly please contact Dr. Marta Gomez-Chiarri, Department of Fisheries, Animal and Veterinary Science, University of Rhode Island, 169 CBLS, Kingston, RI 02881, USA or Dr. Wes Warren, McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis.\nCredits:\nFunding - USDA 20158701622942-Sequencing of the genome of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica to PI - Marta Gomez-Chiarri\nDNA source and isolation - Ximing Guo, Haskin Shellfish Research Laboratory, Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences, Rutgers University, 6959 Miller Avenue, Port Norris, NJ 08349, USA; Dina Proestou, USDA Agricultural Research Service, National Cold Water Marine Aquaculture Center, 469 CBLS, Kingston, RI 02881, USA\nSequencing - McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis.\nAssembly, Assembly/Map Integration - LaDeana Hillier, Chad Tomlinson, Pat Minx, Wesley Warren, McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis.\nAssembly submission - Pat Minx, LaDeana Hillier, McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis.\nLinkage mapping - Yan He and Ximing Guo, Haskin Shellfish Research Laboratory, Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences, Rutgers University, 6959 Miller Avenue, Port Norris, NJ 08349, USA.\nRNAseq data - Dina Proestou, USDA Agricultural Research Service, National Cold Water Marine Aquaculture Center, 469 CBLS, Kingston, RI 02881, USA; Marta Gomez-Chiarri and Tejashree Modak, Department of Fisheries, Animal and Veterinary Science, University of Rhode Island, 169 CBLS, Kingston, RI 02881, USA.\nData use:\nThe Crassostrea virginica sequence is made freely available to the community by McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine, with the following understanding:\n1.
